# French Web Domain Classification

The goal of the project is to classify a French Web Graph into the corresponding category/domain.

The Data Set that we were given is the French web graph where nodes correspond to domains (~28K domains). A directed edge between two nodes indicates that there is a hyperlink from at least one page of the source domain to at least one page of the target domain.
We were also given the raw text extracted from all the pages of each domain.

We will be using a Natural Language Processing approach combined with a Graph Analysis approach in order to complete our task.
